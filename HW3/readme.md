# Week 3 ReadME questions
This week I had some struggles with figuring out the impelentation of the on click functions but once I read more thouroughly through the materials for the week and looked at the different ways you could do it through the W3 school site it became pretty simple. I think a success of mine this week would be with the html and CSS. I am finally starting to get back into the rythm of things with making CSS files and getting the styling and formatting of pages right after not having done much web development for about a year.
