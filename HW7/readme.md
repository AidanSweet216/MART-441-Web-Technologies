# Week 7 
This week's assignment was much easier compared to last week. I was able to fully understand the concepts without needing to get any outside help. I decided to span my work out over the course of a few days which really helped lighten the load and reduce my stress when it came to completing the assignment. The hardest thing about this week was simply finding art as social justice movements aren't really something I follow and I think the art I chose is a bit more closely related to a topic I care about. While the subject of ocean conservation isn't really under the banner of social justice I think it is still an important issue in today's society and deserves attention. Overall I really enjoyed this assignment.
