# Week 2 homework response
This week was nice to get back into doing JavaScript. For me it was really simple implementing a console.log and connecting a js file to an html page as I have been doing things like this for about 2 years now throughout various different courses I've taken for my major. The only thing I think I really struggled with was when I had to name 3 artists that I like and their cultural impact. I don't really follow any sort of traditional artists and the one that I do like I don't really know anything about other than I like his paintings. Really looking forward to getting into more complex JavaScript in the coming weeks.
