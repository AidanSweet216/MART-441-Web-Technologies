# Week 12 Homework
By golly this week really kicked my butt. The course work was difficult and took me a while to understand but once I started getting the hang of it disaster struck. I had put together the framework of my assignment over the weekend and I was working on finishing it on Monday when the university's internet went out. IT told us they didn't know when it would be back on and I went into panic mode. I had no way to continue working as I couldn't push to GitHub or access the course materials to help me get things working. Eventually the internet did come back and I was able to finish in time.
