# Week 6 ReadME
This week kicked my butt like no other week has. I thought it would be simple since we were just adding onto our assignment from last week. Boy was I wrong. I ran into roadblock after roadblock trying to get my code to work properly and no matter what I tried it just wouldn't work. Thankfully I was able to catch Professor Cassens in his office after I got out of my screenwriting class and he walked me through the process and showed me what I was doing wrong and what aspects of my code I was really close but was only off by a little bit. It definitely is a big help having someone in person able to walk me through how these different aspects of JavaScript work and help me figure things out on my own rather than just telling me what to do. Big shout out to Michael, he came in clutch as usual and helped me get this assignment finished on time.
