            Welcome to my first web page of this semester. Below you will find some information about myself regarding my academics as well as some professional work I am currently a part of

                Information about Aidan
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am from Seattle, Washington and a senior at the University of Montana majoring in Media Arts with a concentration in game design and interactive media. I am on track to graduate in December 2023 and I have been on either the President's List or Dean's list every semester since I started at UM in Fall 2020
            </p>
           
            <p>
                I am also currently working as a freelance game designer on a VR project in collaboration with the School of Forestry and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. My primary role within the development team for this game is that of the level and environment designer. I really enjoy this job, as level design is the aspect of game design that interests me the most and I think I'm pretty good at it

                Why did I take this class?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Well the first reason I took this class really is quite simple, it is required for my major. But that reason aside I still am interested in this class and what I can learn
            </p>
            <p>
                I've enjoyed the other classes in web design and web based programming and would like to improve my skills in web development. My chosen career field can be very tough to break into and any skills I can acquire to help me stand are always a plus

                Post graduation plans
            </h1>
            <p>
                Next December when I say my goodbyes to this wonderful school I plan on heading back to Seattle to try and find work in the games industry. There is a high number of game development studios back in the western Washington area and it would be nice to find a job where I won't have to move to a different part of the country away from all my friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if I cannot find work at a local studio I am open to working remotely as well or even doing more freelance contract work. As long as I am designing video games I will be happy
