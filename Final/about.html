    <p>
        Aidan Sweet is an undergraduate student at the University of Montana studying Game Design and Interactive Media and will graduate from the university in December 2023.
        He is currently working as a freelance Game Designer on a VR game with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the University of Montana. Wanting to branch out into more realms of game design, this semester Aidan started learning how to make 3D assets for games.
        On this site you will find examples of the work that Aidan has created this semester as he delved into 3D asset creation.
